Papers in this category delve into sports-related injuries, prevention strategies, and rehabilitation protocols. Studies cover diverse topics, including genetic 
predisposition to injuries, neuromuscular rehabilitation after strokes, and specialized training methods for athletes. The aim is to minimize injuries, enhance
 recovery, and optimize athletes' performance. A sample of my studies are referenced below. 

-	The comparison and association of incidence and severity of exercise-induced injuries among various genotypes of ACTN3 in Iranian male elite weightlifters
