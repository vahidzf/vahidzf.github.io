This category encompasses research on innovative and specialized training techniques, such as rebound therapy and unique exercise programs tailored for specific populations, like individuals with autism or depression. These studies explore non-traditional methods to improve physical and mental well-being, often with a focus on enhancing self-esteem and overall quality of life. A sample of my studies in this category follows.

-	Effect of Kangoo Jump Training on the Balance Function of Autistic Children with High Performance Level
-	Applying a computational intelligence method to predict the rehabilitation treatment for females with lateral patellar displacement
-	Effect of rebound therapy exercises on the quality of life in the female students with major depression disorder (MMD)
-	Effect of rope jumping exercise on postural control, static and dynamic balance in boy students with flat foot
-	Effect of aerobics exercise on self-esteem in Iranian female adolescents covered by welfare organization
