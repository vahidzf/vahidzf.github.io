Papers in this category delve into the physiological aspects of exercise, including intensity estimation, performance enhancement, and analysis of various 
training methods. Research topics span from high-intensity interval training's impact on insulin resistance to analyzing gait stability in individuals with 
spinal cord injuries. The studies aim to uncover the intricacies of exercise physiology and improve training efficiency.  A sample of my studies are referenced below. 

-	Effects of 12-week high-intensity interval training on plasma visfatin concentration and insulin resistance in overweight men
-	Effects of exercise rehab on male asthmatic patients: aerobic versus rebound training
-	Estimation of aerobic exercise intensity in healthy young females by the counting talk test
-	Stability Analysis in Individuals with Complete and Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury: Linear Versus Non-Linear Methods
-	Determination of proper height of hurdles for continuous double-legged jump in plyometric training
