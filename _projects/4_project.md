Papers in this category delve into the physiological aspects of exercise, including intensity estimation, performance enhancement, and analysis of various 
training methods. Research topics span from high-intensity interval training's impact on insulin resistance to analyzing gait stability in individuals with 
spinal cord injuries. The studies aim to uncover the intricacies of exercise physiology and improve training efficiency.  A sample of my studies are referenced below.
