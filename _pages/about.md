 I am a professor at the University of Isfahan and the University of Safahan. I specialize in exercise rehabilitation for both injured athletes and patients, with expertise in kinesiology, patho-kinesiology, and neuromuscular physiology, as well as statistical analysis and research methods within the field of exercise sciences. My academic journey includes a Ph.D. from the University of Manchester in 1999, which has served as the foundation for my extensive contributions to the field.

Throughout my career, I have authored over 150 articles published in prestigious conferences and journals within my field, solidifying my position as a leading authority in exercise science. Beyond research, I am deeply committed to delivering my students a comprehensive and enriching educational experience.

My dedication to education goes beyond the classroom, as I have provided successful supervision for the research endeavors of more than 18 Ph.D. students and 140 MSc students, leaving a lasting impact on the academic community.

This website offers a glimpse into my academic journey, research contributions, and educational philosophy. Whether you are a student seeking guidance, a fellow researcher, or simply curious about the exciting world of exercise sciences, I hope you find valuable insights and resources here.
