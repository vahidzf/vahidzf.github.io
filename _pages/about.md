<!-- This is my bio on master.   Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
 

I am a professor at the University of Isfahan and the University of Safahan,  and the CEO of Safahan Exercise Rehab Center.

I specialize in exercise rehabilitation for injured athletes and patients. My expertise spans kinesiology, patho-kinesiology, neuromuscular physiology, and statistical analysis in exercise sciences. You can find more information on my [research page](https://vahidzf.github.io/projects/)

This website showcases my academic journey, research, and educational philosophy, offering valuable insights and resources to students, researchers, and exercise science enthusiasts.
